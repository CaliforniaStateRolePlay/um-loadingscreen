MARCH CONTENT UPDATE PT. 2

The second content update for March is now in-game and packed with new maps and features! The second update for this month includes new maps, FPS improvements, and much more!

NEW Sandy Shores Police Department
The Sandy PD has been revamped with a new interior with a more country-style theme. Over a year later, the Sandy PD is looking sharp again with its new revamp!

NEW Shipment PVP Map
A shipment-based PVP map near the Cayo Bridge in Los Santos has been added! This area is KOS and is open for gangs and civilians to test their combat skills.

NEW LEO Super Pack
After nearly 6+ months, a new LEO pack has been released and features some of the best vehicles in an LEO pack! Typically there are 3 vehicles per LEO pack, but this time we have doubled that number and added 6 vehicles, all 300mph+ and custom engine sounds. You can view the preview in ðŸš“ãƒ»leo-pack-1-7-preview 

NEW Ped Trust System
Since the release of personal peds in November, many complaints about ped codes getting leaked, abuse, and more have occurred. Over the last few days, all peds have been assigned and restricted to the owners allowing them to trust/untrust peds to other players. This change will significantly improve the roleplay experience with peds.

Sandy FPS Improvements
We have removed the log cabin, all custom 24/7 interiors, and the boat docks in Sandy Shores. This has shown a significant increase in FPS when playing in sandy and should be lighter on all players.

Maze Bank Arena
The Maze Bank Arena has been removed due to the mass amount of lag experienced when near the interior. A future update will bring back this interior with new mini-games inside!
